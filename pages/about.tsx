          Iâ€™ve been busy working on my little corner of the internet for quite a
          while so thanks for stopping by. If you've been here before the site
          presentation may look unchanged, however I update it every so often
          utilising new skills that I learn - it's currently written in HTML,
          CSS (SASS) and JS (ES6 standards) and my good mate Gulp is now helping
          out with all the manual tasks!
        </p>
        <p>
          I have 9 years of experience working in an Ecommerce environment and
          have been developing professionally for 8 years now.
        </p>
        <p>
          In that time, I've worked for notable companies such as Oliver Bonas,
          Anya Hindmarch, Selfridges and Disney. In 2019 I joined Charlotte
          Tilbury as a Frontend Engineer working on their React app.
