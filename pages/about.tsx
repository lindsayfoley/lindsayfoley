        <p>Iâ€™ve been busy working on my little corner of the internet for quite a while so thank you for stopping by!</p>
        <p>If you've been here before the site may look unchanged but I do update it every so often
        utilising new skills that I learn. Currently it's a React app written in Typescript,
        on the Next.js framework and styled using SASS.</p>

            <p>I have 10 years of experience working in Ecommerce and have been developing professionally for 9 years.</p>
            <p>In that time, I've been very fortunate to work for notable companies including Oliver Bonas, Anya Hindmarch, Selfridges, Disney and most recently Charlotte Tilbury, where I work as a Frontend Engineer on their React site.</p>
