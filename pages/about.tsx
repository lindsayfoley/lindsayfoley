        <p>Iâ€™ve been busy working on my little corner of the internet for quite a while so thanks for stopping by!</p>
        <p>If you've been here before, the site it may look unchanged but I do update it every so often
        utilising new skills that I learn - currently it's a React app written in Typescript,
        on the Next.js framework using SASS.</p>
        <p>I have 9 years of experience working in an Ecommerce environment and have been developing professionally for 8 years now. 
          In that time, I've worked for notable companies such as Oliver Bonas,
          Anya Hindmarch, Selfridges and Disney.
